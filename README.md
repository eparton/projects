# Welcome to my work.

For source code, see projects in Machine Learning, Systems, and Security.
I enjoyed working with both Python and C, however for very different reasons.
Python allows for such easy access to lists and simple interface with objects.
I could comfortably convert an idea of data organization to code. And of
course, not having to manage memory was a joy.
C on the other hand allowed me to muck with memory and easy use of Linux
systems calls, I felt powerful, and it was shocking to see how much of a system
you really can control. Yet quickly I realized the power imposed a cautious
responsibility for the low level moving parts.

For research papers, see MiddleburyTheses and Security.
